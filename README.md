# FaceRecognition2023
Welcome! This is my Senior Project for Sewickley Academy's Class of 2023. 

1) Face Verification.ipynb is the full code behind my own face recognition models. Some folders need to be created locally. Guided by Nicholas Renotte's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKispFFQ5GU
2) faceApp.py integrates my model into a Tkinter application, for demonstration purposes.
3) faceRecApp.py demonstrates live face recognition in a Tkinter application, incorporating the Python face_recognition package by Adam Geitgey.
